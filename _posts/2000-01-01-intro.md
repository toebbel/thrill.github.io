# *Thrill*

Thrill is a C++ framework for distributed Big Data computations on a cluster of machines. It is currently being designed and developed as a research project at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](http://algo2.iti.kit.edu) and is in early testing.

The [development code is available on github](http://github.com/thrill/thrill) under the MIT license and outside contributors are welcome to join and contact us. [Doxygen documentation](http://i10login.iti.kit.edu/c7adox/) automatically built from the master is available.
